        <h2>Data on Telemedicine in Kenya</h2>
        <img id="img5" src="doctor6.png" alt="doctors" width="500" height="200">
        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the adoption of telemedicine in Kenya is increasing, with a growing number of healthcare providers offering telemedicine services.
            The WHO estimates that telemedicine can improve access to healthcare for people living in rural or remote areas of Kenya, where access to healthcare facilities may be limited.
            Telemedicine can also reduce the burden on Kenya's healthcare system by reducing the number of in-person visits to clinics and hospitals.</p>
